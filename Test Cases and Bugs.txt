*/

Test Cases:

1: 8/2+4*3 = 16
2: 2/0: Divison by Zero Error
3: Any operator with no value: Should display a message in console saying it couldn't perform operation
    Ex: Hitting '+' when the expression = '' it should put an error message in the console
4: 8/0 + 2: Division By Zero Error
5: 2+3-6*2 = -7

Bugs:

8/12/20
1: When hitting equals after solving an expression, an error it displayed in the console that says:
     "Uncaught TypeError: expression.split is not a function"
2: It does allow you to stack operators; It does display an error message (NaN), but we should prevent it from happening
    Ex: 1 + + + +
